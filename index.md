Welcome!


I am a political science PhD student in University of Rochester. I got my Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from Yonsei University. My research interests mostly center around international political economy, domestic politics & IR, trade policy, political lobbying, formal theory and political methodology. What I currently focus on is formalization and empirical verification of the effect of informational transparency between government, firms and median voters in shaping a domestic government’s decisions on free trade.
