  description: "This course trains students to use large language models (LLMs) for real-world data workflows. Students learn to clean, link, and structure complex textual data using both discriminative and generative models. The course emphasizes selecting and applying appropriate open-source models, such as LayoutLM, SentenceTransformers, DeBERTa, and GPT, for specific analytical tasks including data cleansing, record linkage, stance detection, fine-tuning, and structured data extraction from unstructured sources. Students also gain practical experience leveraging GPU computing resources through Google Colab for efficient model training and inference."
